# Catalog

This project will showcase my ability to create a web app with 
authentication, CRUD operation as well as API endpoint via JSON.

## Running the web app:
To run the app, we want to set up the database first. To set it up, use 
the command `python ./database_setup.py`
To actually run the app, use the command `python ./catalog.py`
